Project "Fetch API" - Genius Monkey

Hope you guys enjoy this little example. The first section was more to showcase my frontend design ability, and the second portion I wanted to complete asap for you guys, so the functionality is there, even though it is not the prettiest, but the API's and outputs are functional.

Only thing I would change is to set the changes in a useEffect so whenever a dealer is changed, it will automatically update the other outputs in an instant without having to refresh and switch the dealer.

API Calls are in these files:

Fetch all Dealers - https://github.com/gioadorno/geniusmonkeyapi/blob/8527945b3533ad06764cabb8f0e64ea68f62ace1/pages/index.js

All other fetch/puts - https://github.com/gioadorno/geniusmonkeyapi/blob/8527945b3533ad06764cabb8f0e64ea68f62ace1/components/Form.jsx
