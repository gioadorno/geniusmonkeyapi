Project "Fetch API" - Genius Monkey

Hope you guys enjoy this little example. The first section was more to showcase my frontend design ability, and the second portion I wanted to complete asap for you guys, so the functionality is there, even though it is not the prettiest, but interface will update when user changes an option/dealer.

API Calls are in these files:

Fetch all Dealers - https://github.com/gioadorno/geniusmonkeyapi/blob/8527945b3533ad06764cabb8f0e64ea68f62ace1/pages/index.js

All other fetch/puts - https://github.com/gioadorno/geniusmonkeyapi/blob/8527945b3533ad06764cabb8f0e64ea68f62ace1/components/Form.jsx
